The following things can be done better:

Documentation
   Right now most functions have a very brief Doxygen comment, but better information could be given for most of them.

OpenGL Code
   The graphics code in qminefield.cpp could be cleaned up a bit.  Could also probably be made a bit faster.

Custom Size
   Most 2D variants of the game allow setting a custom size.  The underlying software supports this already, there's just no interface to it.
