Although Minesweeper 3D is a fairly complete game, there are still several things that need to be changed.
The following is a list of changes that should be made at some point:

Clean up the drawing code.
   Right now the drawing code is slightly more complicated than it needs to be because marked cells, closed cells, and the small numbered boxes are all handled differently.
   In the future the marked cells and closed cells should be given texture maps, so they can be drawn similarly to the small numbered boxes.
   Not only would that simplify the code, it would also allow greater flexibility in the way those boxes are displayed.
   Also, the lightning is a little bit strange for large games.

Add a high score list
   Right now there is now high score list, and hardly any recognition when the game is won.

Fix Win determination code
   Right now the code that determines a "win" is not fully functional, and should be fixed.

Better Documentation
   Right now most functions have a very brief Doxygen comment, but better information should be given for most of them.
